# Error 500 overload mitigation for Apache (.htaccess rule)
An on-the-fly remedy to prevent your website visitors from discontinuing their visit due to a 'Error 500' caused by hosting overload, low processing capacity or high processes running at once in Apache. 
# Description
Some hosting providers not only limit bandwidth but also cap computational capacity to extreme levels. Therefore, even though they advertise their services as 'unlimited,' your website will soon start experiencing failures (Error 500) due to load balancing systems and low processing capacity assigned to your hosting. For instance, it's common in budget hosting to find that they can't support more than 10 WordPress cron tasks running simultaneously, resulting in endless 'Error 500' screens.

The primary solution to this problem is to switch to an honest hosting provider that clearly defines which applications you can install, what limitations exist beyond the 'unlimited' label, and what restrictions apply. While you go through the migration process to a new hosting provider (or in case your budget or circumstances don't allow it), I've created a simple page that loads in case an Error 500 occurs. It merely refreshes the page being visited, which, in 99% of cases, means the page loads correctly, and most importantly, we don't lose the visitor.

In essence, this proof of concept (which I use on many hosting providers and it works correctly) aims to ensure that a visitor to our website doesn't leave just because the page they intended to view doesn't load. Period.
